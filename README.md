# Javahtzee
A version of the classic, public-domain Yacht game written in Java

On most systems (Linux/MacOS) giving executable permissions to buildJavahtzee and executing it will create a JAR file.
On Windows, buildJavahtzee can be modified to a .BAT file for the same purpose.

Note that I created Javahtzee because the closest comparable application, OpenYahtzee, does not provide macOS binaries, 
and does not provide instructions for compiling on macOS.  For this reason, I have tested the GUI elements almost exclusively
on macOS (12.4). On other platforms, tweaking some of the GUI elements may be necessary for a good experience.
